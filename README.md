# XYZ Framework for .NET 4.6+
Separation of Concerns and abstraction library.

## Primary Target Dev Stack
UNITY, MONO, Alternate GUI (GTK, Etc)

## What it does
XYZ allows for creating a Model/Glue/View application where all functionality aside from the direct GUI code is handled in 
abstracted layers. 

XYZ offers wrappers to build system functionality on to integrate with business and view logic. These wrappers allow for
replacing backend source such as Libraries, Frameworks, etc or Reimplementation of such code without changing the consumer
code. In otherwords, it localizes and abstracts "heavy lifting".
