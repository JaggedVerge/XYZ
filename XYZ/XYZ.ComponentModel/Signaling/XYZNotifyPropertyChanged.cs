/*  
 * XYZ is a .NET 4.6 abstraction and implementation Framework designed for Unity and other .NET/Mono platforms
 *
 * XYZ is a toolkit designed to ease the burden of to-the-metal system functionality and to strongly separate business concerns.
 * Implemented as an abstraction library, XYZ provides full implementation tools for:
 *
 * - creating strongly bound, yet firmly separated concerns in any tier
 * - Creating View Logic for UI
 * - Creating Robust Models
 * - Tightly Integrated Domain code for acting with or without a View alongside Models
 * - Sensible wrapper layers to facilitate quickly swapping out backend logic without nessicitating rewriting consumption code
 * 
 * In plain terms:
 * XYZ allows you to create highly maintainable, cleanly separated code. 
 * XYZ allows you to implement a Model/View/Glue pattern in platforms such as UNITY, MONO & WinForms.
